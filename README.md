# Hi, I'm Joseph Chisom Ofonagoro

**Cyber Security (SOC & CTI) Analyst | OSINT analyst**

I help organizations in detecting threats using SOC solutions, build detection pipelines with AWS-native tools, and automate incident response workflows. I focus on solving real problems, improving response speed, and documenting everything I learn.

## About Me

I'm currently a 200 level student of Computer Science, advancing a career in cybersecurity, while still being a Technical Writer.

My current work revolves around **setting up SIEM solutions to monitor and defend threats. Additionally, I combine OSINT skills as a CTI analyst to find cues that may be of harm to organizations**. 

As a SOC Analyst, I set up tools to observe aggregated logs, which inform me on how best to respond to them. From a CTI standpoint, I also use monitoring tools to find potential threats, investigate them, and report to the relevant stakeholders.

Tools I use often include: 
**Graylog:** for aggregating logs from different devices.
**Wireshark:** for analysing network packets
**Spiderfoot:** for running reconnainse on points of interest

I frequently share my work online to show educate my audience on what I do.

## Projects (Active and Upcoming)

### Active
- **Cloud Based SIEM on AWS EC2** - Spinned up a SIEM using Graylog to coallate logs from different endpoints. An ongoing project, with more refinements to be added.
- **SOC Triaging** ‚Äì Participated in a 2-hour Real time SOC Simulation project and achieved over 90% true positive detection twice.  
- **OSINT GEOLOCATION** ‚Äì Using OSINT Technologies, and few cues, I traced different locations, each time, finding where they are located.
- **Tracking a Fugitive** ‚Äì Used Digital footprints to find informations about a person's past. 

### Upcoming
- **Real Time Threat Isolation on Graylog** ‚Äì Use SOAR tools to automate incident response
- **Cloud Security Monitoring** ‚Äì Implement tools like GuardDuty to monitor for security breahces  
- **Threat Intelligence** ‚Äì Enrich Graylog with Threat Intel tools to detect and flag known malicious IPs and files running on its clients.
